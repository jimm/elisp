;;; INSTALLATION:
;;;
;;; To use this package, simply put it in a file called "crypt++.el" in a Lisp
;;; directory known to Emacs (see `load-path'), byte-compile it (ignore
;;; warnings about undefined functions), and put the line:
;;;
;;;    (require 'crypt++)
;;;
;;; in your ~/.emacs file or in the file default.el in the ../lisp directory
;;; of the Emacs distribution.
;;; 
;;; For reliable operation with Emacs versions with coding system
;;; support, you also need:
;;; 
;;;    (modify-coding-system-alist 'file "\\.bz\\'" 'no-conversion)
;;;    (modify-coding-system-alist 'file "\\.bz2\\'" 'no-conversion)
;;;    (modify-coding-system-alist 'file "\\.gpg\\'" 'no-conversion)
;;;    (modify-coding-system-alist 'file "\\.gz\\'" 'no-conversion)
;;;    (modify-coding-system-alist 'file "\\.Z\\'" 'no-conversion)
;;; 
;;; With XEmacs, you need 'no-conversion-unix instead of 'no-conversion.
;;; (Thanks to Jose M. Vidal <vidal@sc.edu>.)
;;; 
;;; Otherwise, Emacs tampers with the bytes before crypt++ gets them.
;;; The above won't help for files without those extensions.  You just
;;; have to specify the no-conversion coding system manually when
;;; visiting those files, or set no-conversion for all files if that suits you.
;;; 
;;; Do not bother trying to autoload this package; it uses find-file and
;;; write-file hooks and thus should be loaded the first time you visit
;;; any sort of file.  Any package loaded after this one that appends
;;; something to `write-file-hooks' will not be executed because this
;;; package writes out the file.  Other packages that append to
;;; `write-file-hooks' should either be modified to prepend to that hook
;;; or be loaded before this one (preferably the former).
;;;
;;; An alternative is to stick (require 'crypt) in your ~/.emacs, if it is not
;;; already there, and then make a symbolic link from crypt++.el to crypt.el
;;; with "ln -s crypt++.el crypt.el".  This will make crypt++ act like a
;;; drop-in replacement for the original crypt since any package requiring
;;; crypt will find crypt++ instead.

;;; NOTE: encryption users should set `crypt-encryption-type' to one of the
;;; values in `crypt-encryption-alist' (see USAGE below).

;;; SPECIAL NOTES:
;;;
;;; If crypt++ is dumped with the emacs executable, or if it has already been
;;; loaded in an emacs session, then modifying the variables used in building
;;; the encryption and encoding tables will have no effect until these tables
;;; are rebuilt.  This may be done with `M-x crypt-rebuild-tables'.  See USAGE
;;; below to determine variables for which this is needed.  For example,
;;; post-load changes to `crypt-encryption-file-extension' or
;;; `crypt-freeze-vs-fortran' can be incorporated into the encryption table
;;; via `M-x crypt-rebuild-tables'.  Similarly, post-load changes to
;;; `crypt-bind-insert-file' are handled with `M-x crypt-bind-insert-file'.

;;; DUMPING CRYPT++ WITH GNU EMACS 18:
;;;
;;; If crypt++ has been dumped with emacs then calls to `crypt-rebuild-tables'
;;; and `crypt-bind-insert-file' will be needed in the user's ~/.emacs or
;;; ../lisp/default.el file in order to assure the changes take effect.  For
;;; example,
;;;
;;;           ;; Set my own preferences...
;;;           (setq crypt-encryption-type 'des
;;;                 crypt-encryption-file-extension "\\(\\.e\\)$"
;;;                 crypt-bind-insert-file nil
;;;                 crypt-freeze-vs-fortran nil)
;;;
;;;           ;; Has crypt++ been loaded already?
;;;           (if (featurep 'crypt++)
;;;
;;;               ;; Yes.  Just rebuild the encryption and encoding tables
;;;               ;; and key binding.
;;;               (progn
;;;                 (crypt-rebuild-tables)
;;;                 (crypt-bind-insert-file))
;;;
;;;             ;; No.  Load the whole thing.
;;;             (require 'crypt++))
;;;
;;; This guarantees that the users preferences will be incorporated into
;;; crypt++ without having to reload all of crypt++.el to do it.
;;;
;;; In GNU Emacs 19 and Lucid Emacs 19.8 the execution of
;;; `crypt-rebuild-tables' and `crypt-bind-insert-file' is done automatically
;;; through `after-init-hook'.  So, for the above example, all that is needed
;;; is
;;;
;;;           ;; Set my own preferences...
;;;           (setq crypt-encryption-type 'des
;;;                 crypt-encryption-file-extension "\\(\\.e\\)$"
;;;                 crypt-bind-insert-file nil
;;;                 crypt-freeze-vs-fortran nil)
;;;
;;;           (require 'crypt++)
;;;
;;; There is an `after-init-hook' in Lucid Emacs v 19.8 but in early versions
;;; of Lucid Emacs it will use `term-setup-hook' instead.


;;; USAGE:
;;;
;;; By default, intended to be transparent.  User-defined variables
;;;
;;;     controlling ENCRYPTION are:
;;;        crypt-encryption-type
;;;        crypt-encryption-file-extension
;;;        crypt-never-ever-decrypt
;;;        crypt-auto-write-buffer-encrypted
;;;        crypt-confirm-password
;;;        crypt-encrypted-disable-auto-save
;;;        crypt-encryption-alist
;;;        crypt-pgp-pub-multirecipients
;;;
;;;     controlling ENCODING are:
;;;        crypt-auto-decode-buffer
;;;        crypt-auto-write-buffer
;;;        crypt-query-if-interactive
;;;        crypt-no-extension-implies-plain

;;;        crypt-default-encoding
;;;        crypt-encoded-disable-auto-save
;;;        crypt-encoding-alist
;;;
;;;     controlling file insertion are:
;;;        crypt-bind-insert-file
;;;        crypt-auto-decode-insert
;;;
;;; To find out more about these variables, load this file, put your cursor at
;;; the end of any of the variable names, and hit C-h v [RET].
;;;
;;; NOTE: encryption users should set `crypt-encryption-type' to one of the
;;; values in `crypt-encryption-alist'.
;;;
;;; Although rarely needed, the following may be called interactively:
;;;        (crypt-encoded-mode)
;;;        (crypt-encode-region)
;;;        (crypt-encrypted-mode)
;;;        (crypt-encrypt-region)
;;;        (crypt-set-encryption-key)
;;;        (crypt-rebuild-tables)
;;;        (crypt-insert-file)
;;;        (crypt-bind-insert-file)
;;;        (crypt-submit-report)
;;;        (crypt-pgp-pub-clear-recipients)
;;;
;;; To find out more about these functions, load this file, put your cursor
;;; inside any of the `()' of the above lines, and hit C-h f [RET].

;;; NOTES ON INTERFACES WITH OTHER PROGRAMS AND PACKAGES:
;;;
;;; GZIP: the environment variable GZIP of gzip can cause an error if it
;;; contains `--verbose' because standard output messages will be appended to
;;; gzip'ed files.  This corrupts the files.  The cleanest solution is to pass
;;; the `--quiet' switch in `crypt-encoding-alist' to override this.  Use gzip
;;; version 1.0.4 or higher from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gzip-*.tar.gz.
;;;
;;; TAR-MODE: works properly with version 1.28 (or higher) with v19 emacs.
;;;
;;; RMAIL and CHANGING MAJOR MODE (for v18 ONLY): in v18 emacs
;;; crypt++.el's buffer local variables are smashed whenever the major
;;; mode is changed of a buffer or whenever RMAIL is run on an encrypted
;;; and/or compressed file.  This screws things up.  No smashing occurs
;;; with v19 Emacs.  for v18 emacs Joe Wells' "kill-fix.el" is needed to
;;; prevent this.  Get a copy of kill-fix.el from
;;; archive.cis.ohio-state.edu, store it where emacs can find it, stick
;;; a "(require 'kill-fix)" anywhere in your ~/.emacs, and the problem
;;; will be fixed.
;;;
;;; LISPDIR: if you save this file as crypt++.el then the "(require 'crypt)"
;;; in lispdir.el needs to be replaced with "(require 'crypt++)"
;;; or the symbolic link suggested above can be used.


;;; DESCRIPTION:
;;;
;;; The basic purpose of this package of Lisp functions is to recognize
;;; automatically encrypted and encoded (i.e., compressed) files when they are
;;; first visited or written.  The BUFFER corresponding to the file is decoded
;;; and/or decrypted before it is presented to the user.  The file itself is
;;; unchanged on the disk.  When the buffer is subsequently saved to disk, a
;;; hook function re-encodes the buffer before the actual disk write takes
;;; place.
;;;
;;; This package recognizes all sorts of compressed files by a magic number at
;;; the beginning of these files but uses a heuristic to detect encrypted
;;; files.  If you are asked for an encryption key for a file that is in fact
;;; not encrypted, just hit RET and the file will be accepted as is, and the
;;; crypt minor mode will not be entered.
;;;
;;; Other types of encoding programs may be added to this package by using the
;;; variable `crypt-encoding-alist' which contains a table of encoding
;;; programs such as compress, gzip (GNU zip), freeze, and compact.
;;;
;;; This new extended version of crypt now monitors the filename extensions of
;;; buffers that are written out using write-file (C-x C-w).  If the filename
;;; extension matches one of the extensions listed in `crypt-encoding-alist,'
;;; then this package will write the file out using the corresponding encoding
;;; (compression) method. This is done whether or not the buffer originated
;;; from a previously encoded (compressed) file.
;;;
;;; Thus, if the user is editing a file that may or may not have been encoded
;;; originally (e.g., foobar.Z or foobar) and decides to write it to a
;;; different file (e.g., barfoo or barfoo.z or barfoo.C).  This package will
;;; examine the filename extension and write the buffer in plain format or an
;;; alternate encoding (compression) format by searching through the entries
;;; in the table of encoding methods `crypt-encoding-alist.'  This change in
;;; encoding state is done automatically if the variable
;;; `crypt-auto-write-buffer' is t otherwise the user is asked.


;;; TO DO/KNOWN BUGS/HELP WANTED/APPLY WITHIN:
;;;
;;; All users/hackers out there are strongly encouraged to pursue any of these
;;; matters further (especially those that concern encryption and decryption!).
;;; It is important to future programmers and modifiers of crypt++.el to know
;;; about its perceived limitations.  Since necessity drives invention, users
;;; who find any of the following features of crypt++.el annoying are asked to
;;; make suggestions and send patches (again, especially those that concern
;;; encryption and decryption!).
;;;
;;; * currently crypt++ assumes that if a file is both encrypted and encoded
;;;   (i.e., compressed) that the order in which it was done was encryption
;;;   first _then_ compression.  As has been pointed by many people compression
;;;   following encryption is useless since the encrypted file is basically
;;;   random.  On the other hand, many agree that doing encryption _following_
;;;   compression is better since it makes it harder to crack the encryption.
;;;   We would like to make the ordering of these two user-configurable or if
;;;   nothing else change the order.
;;;
;;;   Having read the above however, Francois Pinard <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>
;;;   writes that encryption following compression may not be harder to crack
;;;   since "the fact that the first few uncrypted bytes are expected (the
;;;   compress signature) facilitates a serious attempt at uncrypting."
;;;   jwz agrees with Francois.
;;;
;;; * get write-region and append-to-file to handle encoded and encrypted
;;;   files.  There is an interesting low-level encoding package by Jay Adams
;;;   <jka@ece.cmu.edu> called jka-compr.el that might address some of these
;;;   issues.  We encourage hackers out there to come up with crypt++ versions
;;;   of write-region and append-to-file.  The difficulty is creating versions
;;;   that mimic the originals as closely as possible.
;;;
;;; * instead of using call-process-region (which can fail badly if the region
;;;   is large and there's not much room in /tmp), write the region to a temp
;;;   file (with a customisable location) and use call-process directly.
;;;
;;; * users have mentioned trouble using crypt++ and hilit simultaneously since
;;;   the functions in write-file-hook for both write the file to disk and
;;;   return t.  A possible solution is to have one of them write to a
;;;   scratch buffer instead of to disk and return nil and then allow the
;;;   other to do its work on the scratch buffer and write it to disk.  Thanks
;;;   to Wayne Folta <folta@cs.UMD.EDU> and Amir J Katz <amir@matis.ingr.com>.
;;;   It would be nice to have another way in emacs to have an
;;;   after-write-file-hook and a before-write-file-hook of some sort.
;;;   Lucid Emacs has an after-write-file-hook.  Recent versions of hilit19.el
;;;   do not automatically attach to `write-file-hooks' and return t.
;;;   However, the general problem of multiple packages returning t still
;;;   remains.  dos-mode.el and crypt++.el also conflict.
;;;
;;; * another possible source of trouble is with encryption (and encoding)
;;;   programs sticking verbose output into buffers prior to being written to
;;;   disk.  This was definitely occurring with gzip because of --verbose in
;;;   the GZIP environment variable and is solved/hidden with the --quiet
;;;   switch.  However, I suspect that some encryption problems out there are
;;;   capable of similar things so the user should be careful.
;;;
;;; * integrating crypt++ with a backgrounding package such as Olin Shivers'
;;;   `background.el' might be useful too.  thanks to Mark Borges
;;;   <mdb@noaacrd.Colorado.EDU> for suggesting this.
;;;
;;; * Performing M-x crypt-encode-buffer or M-x crypt-encrypt-buffer and then
;;;   saving the file would possibly cause errors.  It is better to toggle
;;;   `crypt-encoded-mode' (or `crypt-encrypted-mode') and simply save the
;;;   file.  It is for this reason that `crypt-encode-buffer' and
;;;   `crypt-encrypt-buffer' are not interactive.
;;;
;;; * use plists instead of alists replacing calls to `nth' with `get'
;;;
;;; * merge encryption code completely into encoding code making encryption
;;;   just a special case of encoding.

;;;   lrd: pass the -q switch to gzip to thwart the possibility of a --verbose

;;; 2.28 -
;;;   lrd: added two new variables in (crypt-submit-report) to the list stuck
;;;   at the bottom of the mail message; changed the comments regarding the
;;;   user-defined variables.  added in default values in user defined
;;;   variables.  added to and removed stuff to the `TO DO' list.
;;;
;;;   (encoded-mode):
;;;   added in code to remove any auto-save-files that may have been formed
;;;   before becoming an encoded buffer (for example a plain file saved to
;;;   disk encoded had orphan auto-save-files left behind).  turning off
;;;   auto-save-mode disables the creation of auto-save-files, but it also
;;;   disables the possibility of these being removed when the buffer is
;;;   saved.
;;;
;;;   (crypt-region):
;;;   now call the encryption and decryption program directly instead of
;;;   through the shell.  this is more secure since the shell will expose the
;;;   password (key).  thanks to Jon Cargille <jcargill@cs.wisc.edu>.  defined
;;;   two new variables `crypt-decryption-args' and `crypt-encryption-args' to
;;;   take the arguments separately.  removed (let ((opoint)...)) construct
;;;   this was a throw back to some old dead code and was not being used.
;;; 2.29 -
;;;   lrd: added three new variables in (crypt-submit-report); added to the
;;;   `TO DO' list.
;;;
;;;   (encode-region,encode-buffer,encoded-mode): fixed interactive forms -
;;;   the conversion to table version had eliminated some of the interactive
;;;   features of these.  thanks to Kimball Collins <kpc@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov>
;;;   for point this out.  new interactive form uses functions
;;;   `crypt-get-encoding-type' and `crypt-symbol-alist-to-table' and variable
;;;   `crypt-default-encoding' to generate completion list of encoding types.
;;;
;;;   (crypt-write-file-hook): two new user-defined variables
;;;   `crypt-query-if-interactive' and `crypt-no-extension-implies-plain' and
;;;   the buffer-local variable `buffer-interactive-mode' are used to help
;;;   determined whether or not plain output is really desired for files
;;;   without a compression file-name extension.  the default behavior is the
;;;   same as before.
;;; 2.30 -
;;;   lrd: added test for user-defined variable `crypt-never-ever-decrypt'
;;;   when finding a file.  some users may never wish to decrypt files
;;;   and like to edit binary files.  thanks to Nelson Minar
;;;   <nelson@reed.edu>.  added to doc-strings of
;;;   `crypt-magic-regexp[-inverse]' -- these can be set to nil[t] and
;;;   accomplish the same thing as setting `crypt-never-ever-decrypt' to t
;;; 2.31 -
;;;   rjw: Updated the comments in the encryption check section.
;;; 2.32 - [posted to gnu.emacs.sources]
;;;   lrd: added warning about `crypt-(de|en)cryption-program'; doc mod.
;;; 2.33 -

ENCRYPTION-TYPE is a symbol denoting the encryption type.

MAGIC-REGEXP regexp that must match very close to the beginning of an
encrypted buffer.  This may also be some elisp expression to be evaluated at
\(point-min\) that will return t for an encrypted buffer.  If this is set to
nil then crypt++ will never try to decrypt a buffer.  Currently set to the
internal variable `crypt-encryption-magic-regexp' which will match non-ASCII
characters.

MAGIC-REGEXP-INVERSE regexp that must _NOT_ match very close to the beginning
of an encrypted buffer.  This may also be some elisp expression to be
evaluated at \(point-min\) that will return t for a NON-encrypted buffer.
If this is set to t then crypt++ will never try to decrypt a buffer.
Currently set to the internal variable `crypt-encryption-magic-regexp-inverse'
which will match Sun OS, 4.x BSD, and Ultrix executable magic numbers, so
binaries can still be edited (heh) without headaches.

FILE-EXTENSION regexp denoting the file extension usually appended the
filename of files encrypted with ENCRYPT-PROGRAM.  The variable
`crypt-encryption-file-extension' will over ride the default.

ENCRYPT-PROGRAM name of executable file to be used for encryption.

DECRYPT-PROGRAM name of executable file to be used for decryption.

ENCRYPT-ARGS arguments to be passed to ENCRYPT-PROGRAM may be a string or a
list of strings or nil.

DECRYPT-ARGS arguments to be passed to DECRYPT-PROGRAM may be a string or a
list of strings or nil.

MINOR-MODE string denoting the name for the encrypted minor mode as it will
appear in the mode line.

GARBAGE-REGEXP-OR-LISPEXP dummy variable for compatibility with encoding.

FILE-EXTENSION-TRICKS is t or nil depending on whether or not tricks
converting between different encryption types can be done based on
FILE-EXTENSION; typically t.

ENCRYPTION-KEY-STDIN is t if the encryption key should be passed to the
encryption program on stdin, or nil if it should be appended to the end
of the command line.  It is more secure to pass it on stdin.

ENCODING-TYPE is a symbol denoting the encoding type.  Currently known
encodings are (compress compact freeze gzip).

MAGIC-REGEXP is a regexp that matches the magic number at the
beginning of files encoded with ENCODING-TYPE.

MAGIC-REGEXP-INVERSE dummy variable for compatibility with encryption.

FILE-EXTENSION is a string denoting the file extension usually
appended the filename of files encoded with ENCODING-TYPE.

ENCODE-PROGRAM is a string denoting the name of the executable used to
encode files.

DECODE-PROGRAM is a string denoting the name of the executable used to
decode files.

ENCODE-ARGS arguments to be passed to ENCODE-PROGRAM may be a string or a
list of strings or nil.

DECODE-ARGS arguments to be passed to DECODE-PROGRAM may be a string or a
list of strings or nil.

MINOR-MODE is a string denoting the name for the encoded minor mode as
it will appear in the mode line.

GARBAGE-REGEXP-OR-LISPEXP is (1) a regexp that matches any extraneous text
that is produced by the ENCODE-COMMAND including any newlines and will be
removed from the buffer before saving to disk; (2) a lisp expression that will
clean up extraneous material in the buffer or nil.  This is normally not
needed but can be derived for any ENCODE-COMMAND by checking the standard
error that results from `sh -c \"cat foo | ENCODE-COMMAND > bar\"'.

FILE-EXTENSION-TRICKS is t or nil depending on whether or not tricks
converting between different encoding types can be done based on
FILE-EXTENSION; typically t.

ENCRYPTION-KEY-STDIN is a dummy variable for compatibility with encryption.
