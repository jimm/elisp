;;; Commentary:

;; * Use `testcover-start' to instrument a Lisp file for coverage testing.
;; * Use `testcover-mark-all' to add overlay "splotches" to the Lisp file's
;;   buffer to show where coverage is lacking.  Normally, a red splotch
;;   indicates the form was never evaluated; a brown splotch means it always
;;   evaluted to the same value.
;; * Use `testcover-next-mark' (bind it to a key!) to jump to the next spot
;;   that has a splotch.

;; * Basic algorithm: use `edebug' to mark up the function text with
;;   instrumentation callbacks, then replace edebug's callbacks with ours.
;; * To show good coverage, we want to see two values for every form, except
;;   functions that always return the same value and `defconst' variables
;;   need show only value for good coverage.  To avoid the brown splotch, the
;;   definitions for constants and 1-valued functions must precede the
;;   references.
;; * Use the macro `1value' in your Lisp code to mark spots where the local
;;   code environment causes a function or variable to always have the same
;;   value, but the function or variable is not intrinsically 1-valued.
;; * Use the macro `noreturn' in your Lisp code to mark function calls that
;;   never return, because of the local code environment, even though the
;;   function being called is capable of returning in other cases.

;; Problems:
;; * To detect different values, we store the form's result in a vector and
;;   compare the next result using `equal'.  We don't copy the form's
;;   result, so if caller alters it (`setcar', etc.) we'll think the next
;;   call has the same value!  Also, equal thinks two strings are the same
;;   if they differ only in properties.
;; * Because we have only a "1value" class and no "always nil" class, we have
;;   to treat as 1-valued any `and' whose last term is 1-valued, in case the
;;   last term is always nil.  Example:
;;     (and (< (point) 1000) (forward-char 10))
;;   This form always returns nil.  Similarly, `if' and `cond' are
;;   treated as 1-valued if all clauses are, in case those values are
;;   always nil.
