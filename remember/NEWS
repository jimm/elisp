* Changes in Remember 2.0

** Remember.el is now part of Emacs 23.

** remember-diary.el has been removed.
Its functionality is now included in remember.el.

** The manual has been greatly improved, reorganized, and split
into two separate manuals.  remember.texi documents features that are
included with Emacs, while remember-extra.texi documents features
which are not included with Emacs.

** The customize interface

*** `remember-mode-hook' has a checkbox for `org-remember-apply-template'.
*** `remember-handler-functions' has a checkbox for `org-remember-handler'.
*** `remember-annotation-functions' has checkboxes for
`org-remember-annotation' and `buffer-file-name'.
*** `remember-before-remember-hook' may now be customized.

** New features

*** New option `remember-in-new-frame' indicates whether to use a
separate frame for capturing remember data.

** Bugfixes

*** Make `remember-mail-date' work well with Mutt.
*** Don't write initial blank line in `remember-store-in-mailbox', which
yields better results in Mutt.

** Compatibility

*** `remember-buffer' has been renamed to `remember-finalize'.
